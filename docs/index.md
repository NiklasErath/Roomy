# Instructions

To run the App on your phone, download and install the APK located in the APK Folder in the root directory or click on the Download Link in the header.

Unfortunately as of now the Feature to generate a Recipe is not available in the APK file, since the key will get blocked automatically when included in the public git repository.
A separate server to handle the requests between the App and OpenAI is needed, which will be a future addition.

To access the OpenAI Recipe Feature with your own API key add this line in your gradle.properties file

OPENAI_API_KEY=yourkey

Clean, Sync and Rebuild the Project

Shared Shopping List: Add groceries and items to the group shopping list. Mark items as purchased so everyone stays updated.

Inventory Tracker: Keep tabs on what’s already in the fridge/shelf to avoid duplicate purchases or forgotten essentials.

Generate Custom Recipes: In need of ideas for what to cook with your left-overs at home? Generate an individual Recipe based on what you have at home with the press of a button.
